# C:DDA Mods
My own mods for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. May be WIP, imbalanced or outdated.

# Currently WIP: Elemental Mutations
Mutation lines based on "classical elements" and/or the zombie evolution lines inspired by such. This is not an attempt to perfectly replicate the zombies as most of them progress into some variation of "big, tough, slow, hit hard", instead each "element" should have its own theme and gameplay feel. Currently implemented:
## Electric line
Inspired by the shocker zombie, but focused more on speed manipulation and hit&run tactics. 

Open issues:
* The discharge fields are supposed to be permanent with no off switch but it needs better quality of life for sleeping without the high electric armour it currently needs to avoid getting zapped by its own fields.
* High speed, limited stamina and potent melee "counter" effects might make this too powerful with guns. I am trying to hold off on core stat changes but need an additional balancing factor which does not (further) hamper melee combat.
* The final combination of electric immunity, husk-like constant electricity fields, electroreceptors and a ranged lightning attack is incredibly powerful.
* Will probably cause a lot of frustration by zapping electronic items and furniture just by walking near it.

## Cryogenic line
No zombie equivalent. This one is heavily inspired by characters such as Mr. Freeze but more focused on cold, cryogenic preservation, stability/stagnation and emotional detachment rather than water ice. You can become very resistant to almost everything, but at what cost?

Open issues:
* A lot of pre-threshold mutations do not suit this line very well, but their effects are hardcoded and very on-theme. Mostly morale and pain manipulation.
* The temperature aspect is very wonky. You are supposed to be comfortable in the cold and resistant to heat but the static body temperature modifiers do not really do this idea justice.
* Similarly the speed modifiers seem to work quite strangely, "cold-blooded" is notoriously based on ambient temperature rather than body temperature which is working to our advantage here but it clearly was not designed to speed you up when you get colder.
* Food and drinks freeze very quickly in your presence, this might get rather annoying. Stock up on ice cream!
* For some reason the various "Immune" mutations keep flip-flopping once you get most other options. This is vanilla behaviour.
* I have no idea how the metabolism adjustments play out long-term in different situations. Other mutations and effects still consume a flat amount of food/drink so the lower consumption might be less impressive than it seems. Also **DO NOT** play this with Imperceptive Healer!
